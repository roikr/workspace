bugs in FDT4:

Sounds Library:
1. it is better to compose of 2 files:
   a. library which store each file with a class in the same name;
   b. const file to store the const and link to the classes name (good for auto completion)


Codes Library:
1. when programming games, we are using the gamemanager API to call the beeps, because we don't want to link the beeps sounds to the game !

to create a class from a library we need to:
1. add the swc to the source path
2. mention its name in the place we want to import it (we can use Impoter array)
3. solving namespace
4. getQualifiedClass with :: ("com.chatpetz.speed::bird")
